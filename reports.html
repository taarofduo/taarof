          <h3>June 25, 2025 – New Haven, CT<br><em>Ely Center of Contemporary Art</em></h3>
          <p>Note: It's too soon for me to write anything for this. Ely Center is an old house. 
          She, the one in red, told me that they are dreaming about this space She mentioned deception
          and multichannel. That gives me a piece of entertainment to watch you being deceived, walking
          with smiles on your face, not knowing what is even real.</p>

          <h3>March 13, 2025 – Washington, D.C.<br><em>SuperCollider Symposium</em>(cancelled)</h3>
          <P>Note: I think this is the third time I have been asked to write a bio for the duo, 
            Taarof: Matt Wellins in New Haven and Parsa Ferdowsi in Philadelphia are engaging in 
            the old tradition of taarof. They are making empty gestures. An empty gesture that is 
            known to be empty and yet is still commonly upheld. It's been awhile since I last saw 
            them perform and I don't know why I accepted the offer to write this text. It is unpaid. 
            It's been really difficult to keep track of them now that they are no longer in the same 
            state. The person who asked me to write this told me there will be text involved this time. 
            Perhaps, after previous failed attempts, P is able to say something. She also told me that 
            M is extremely worried about the recent climate, especially in Washington. I am too. 
            It smells. But she mentioned that he has an updated instruction from a Japanese 
            competition for making pour-over coffee and it might change things. I doubt it. 
            I don't know how she collects this information. It is is difficult to wear red all 
            the time and be surreptitious. The point is that they are being watched exactly 
            as you are are. I'm here. I'm looking at you sitting in your chairs.</P>
          <p>Report: No report available. They cancelled it. Between you and me, what's wrong with them?</p>

          <p>Report: Thank god you were not there. They were taking photos of the audience. I was 
          worried I would be in one of the photos but as soon as P took out the camera I left.</p>

          <h3>September 10, 2024 – New Haven, CT<br><em>The Institute Library</em></h3>
          <p>Note: This is supposed to be the last night of that tour. Once again I will be listening
            from the back of the room while anxiously 
            checking my phone. Is she still wearing red? I hope I see her among the ten people
            who usually come to these shows. I want to know know who is behind this.</p>
          <p>Report: P had an oxygen mask on the whole time. M was sitting on the ground as usual.
          This was rather a decent performance. No one there wearing red.</p>

          <p>Note: Again, Parsa Ferdowsi and Matt Wellins will be playing in the second night of
            what they call a mini-tour. Again, I will be listening from the back of the room while anxiously 
            checking my phone. I am curious about the one who asks me to write these texts.</p>
          <p>Report: I have never seen such a disaster. I can't go on like this. 
          Do they even know what they are involved with? At least they know something about good coffee.
          Or at least one of them knows.</p>

          <p>Report: They were anxious about the weather and it fell upon them for being possessed 
            with a worry summons it.
          Their play was undone by tempets.</p>
