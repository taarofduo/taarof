          <h3>September 10, 2024 – New Haven, CT<br><em>The Institute Library</em></h3>
          <p>Note: This is supposed to be the last night of that tour. Once again I will be listening
            from the back of the room while anxiously 
            checking my phone. Are you still wearing red? I hope I see you among the ten people
            who will usually come to these shows.</p>
          <p>Report: P had an oxygen mask on the whole time. M was sitting on the ground as usual.
          This was rather a decent performance. No one there wearing red.</p>

          <p>Note: Again, Parsa Ferdowsi and Matt Wellins will be playing in the second night of
            what they call a mini-tour. Again, I will be listening from the back of the room while anxiously 
            checking my phone. I am curious about the one who asks me to write these texts.</p>
          <p>Report: I have never seen such a disaster. I can't go on like this. 
          Do they even know what they are involved with? At least they know something about good coffee.
          Or at least one of them knows.</p>

          <p>Note: Parsa Ferdowsi and Matt Wellins will be playing a duet for santur and computer. 
            The runtime is approximately 30 minutes. 
            I will be listening from the back of the room while anxiously checking my phone.</p>
          <p>Report: They were anxious about the weather and it fell upon them for being possessed 
            with a worry summons it.
          Their play was undone by tempets.</p>
